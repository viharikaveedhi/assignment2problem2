#ASSIGNMENT 2 - PROBLEM 1
#Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples



def sort(tuples):                     #for sorting(  in ascending order) the numbers inside the tuples
    return sorted(tuples, key=last)

def last(numbers):                   #to get them return for arranging them in sorted manner
    return numbers[-1]
  
list= [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
print("Sorted:",sort(list))
